# ⚡ VoltStream

> **A Java-based simulation of a decentralized EV charging network demonstrating object-oriented design, dynamic load balancing, and real-time tariff calculation.**

---

## 📖 Overview

VoltStream is a console-based simulation of a smart electric vehicle charging network. It models multiple charging bays operating under a shared electrical grid with limited capacity.

When multiple vehicles request charging simultaneously, the system intelligently distributes available power, dynamically adjusts charging tariffs based on grid utilization, and continuously updates the charging status of every connected vehicle.

The project was built to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through a realistic systems simulation.

```

The **EVNetworkController** acts as the central coordinator by:

- managing charging bays
- allocating available grid power
- dispatching arriving vehicles
- advancing the simulation
- updating charging sessions
